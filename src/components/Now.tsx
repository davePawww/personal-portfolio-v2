				After dedicating five years to Accenture, I decided to prioritize my
				health to ensure I could perform at my highest level in my craft. Once I
				regained my well-being, I transitioned into freelancing, which allowed
				me the flexibility to refine my skills and explore new opportunities. To
				stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech landscape, I also enrolled in
				cutting-edge courses such as the JSM Masterclass and ByteGrad's
				React/NextJS program, ensuring I remain proficient in the latest
				technologies and aligned with industry standards.
